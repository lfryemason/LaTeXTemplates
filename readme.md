### Class Notes Template
#### TemplateClassNotes.tex

This template is for taking notes in a lecture, specifically for math or engineering lectures, but can be used anywhere. 

It has commented out lists and references. You can also add lists inside of lists to get a hierarchy.

Sections are the date of the class.

### Template for Math and/or Coding assignments
#### TemplateMathCoding.tex

This template is useful for assignments that need math or coding portions added. Coding files or portions of code can be added with the commented out lines and will have lines numbered on the side and a different background coloring. Graphics can also be inserted (such as plots or images) with a commented out line.

### Chicago/Turabian style report
#### TemplateChicTurabian.tex

This is a very basic template that allows for bibtex in Chicago/Turabian style.

Useful for UNM MUS361 and MUS362 (Music History).
